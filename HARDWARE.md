## Microphone Housing 3D Drawing 
The Rode microphones are housed in a simple setup where it can be placed on top of the laptop. This housing display was designed in SolidWorks and 3D printed using black PETG filament.

## Future Design

Future senior design groups can follow another design where rather than using a laptop to display BUtLAR, an LCD screen and speakers can replace the laptop (more cost effective). Then this will be placed on a stand that can be adjusted based on a person's height. This is an alternative design approach future groups can consider should they want to replace the laptop.
