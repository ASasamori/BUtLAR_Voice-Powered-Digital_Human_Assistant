## Additional Information

* I did not find any information about the show "I Fine... Thank You... Love You," "Us and Them," or "See You in Time" in the provided context or conversation history. 
* I was unable to answer your previous question about what classes "OH no" teaches, as the reference text and conversation history did not include any information about that. 
* I understand that you were trying to complete the sentence "We're not going to --. It's Alan Pisano [who will] teach --."  However, I need more information to understand what is being asked. Please provide more context or complete the sentence yourself so I can understand it better and provide a relevant answer.
