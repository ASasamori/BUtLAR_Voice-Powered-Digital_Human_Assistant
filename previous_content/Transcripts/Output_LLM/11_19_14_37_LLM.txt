Boston is one of the oldest cities in the United States, founded in 1630. It played a key role in the American Revolution, particularly with events like the Boston Massacre in 1770 and the Boston Tea Party in 1773, which both fueled the movement for American independence. Today, the city is known for its rich history, diverse culture, and as a center for education and innovation, hosting prestigious institutions like Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
