The best months to visit Boston are usually September and October. During this time, the weather is mild, and you can enjoy the beautiful fall foliage. Additionally, these months tend to have fewer tourists compared to the peak summer season, allowing for a more enjoyable experience while exploring the city's historical sites and attractions. Spring (April to June) is also a great time to visit, with warmer weather and blooming flowers.
