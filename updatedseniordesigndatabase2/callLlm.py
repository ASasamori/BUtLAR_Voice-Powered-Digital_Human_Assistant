    Generates SQL queries based on user questions for the eceDay.db schema.
    """
    prompt = f"""
You are a helpful assistant that generates SQL queries for a SQLite database named 'eceDay.db'.

The schema includes:

Table: teams
- team_number (INTEGER)
- team_name (TEXT)
- abstract_summary (TEXT)
- team_members (TEXT)
- team_client (TEXT)
- client_about (TEXT)
- team_location (TEXT)

Table: team_members
- member_id (INTEGER)
- team_member (TEXT)
- team_number (INTEGER)

Instructions:
- Use LOWER(team_name) LIKE LOWER('%...%') for partial team name matching.
- Use team_number = [#] for numeric team lookups.
- If the user asks about team members, JOIN teams and team_members ON team_number.
- Only return the SQL query â€” no explanations.

Examples:
Q: What is SmoothOperator about?
A: SELECT abstract_summary FROM teams WHERE LOWER(team_name) LIKE LOWER('%SmoothOperator%');

Q: Who is in team 14?
A: SELECT team_member FROM team_members WHERE team_number = 14;

Q: Where is Mini Bots?
A: SELECT team_location FROM teams WHERE LOWER(team_name) LIKE LOWER('%Mini Bots%');

Q: Who is the client for team 3?
A: SELECT team_client FROM teams WHERE team_number = 3;

Q: What is the abstract for BUtLAR?
A: SELECT abstract_summary FROM teams WHERE LOWER(team_name) LIKE LOWER('%BUtLAR%');

Now write the query to answer:
{user_question}

Return only the SQL query.
